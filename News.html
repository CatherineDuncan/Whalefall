<h1> Diner is celebrating its anniversary soon</h1>
<h3>Our local diner is preparing for its 70th anniversary! Come by to see if you can help out with the festivities.*</h3>
    <h3 id="disclaimer">*attendance is mandatory</h3>

<h1>Town anniversary</h1>
<h3>Celebrate the 309th year anniversary of our town! We kick off this 
    yearly town event this summer with the giving of our Model Citizen Award. 
    After that, we will have our usual market featuring local vendors and artists, 
    and we will close the evening at 5pm with our Orange Catapult Competition!
</h3>

<h1>Welcomeing!</h1>
<h3>Say hello to our new neighbor! For the first time in over a decade, 
    moving trucks were seen rolling across the Lake Fargo Bridge. Our newest citizen seems far, 
    taking over the old newsletter cabin, but that doesnâ€™t make them a stranger! 
    Be sure to bring a plate of cookies and give them a warm welcome!</h3>

<h1>Emergancy Announcement</h1>
<h3>This week, an unidentified body was discovered on the outer coast of the lake.
    They were found lying face down in the grass by a tree. They were unclothed, and have since been found to be two weeks deceased. 
    The individual has not been identified, likely not being from this town. 
    The body is not suspected to be a victim of any foul play, as all of the craters punched in their skin seem to be coming from
     the inside out. </h3>
